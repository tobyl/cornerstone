          <p class="mb-4">Therapy, also referred to as psychotherapy or counselling, is the process of an individual, family, or group meeting with a therapist to resolve problematic behaviours, beliefs, feelings, relationship issues, and/or somatic complaints (sensations in the body). Engaging in therapy can be a big step toward being the best version of yourself and living the healthiest life possible—no matter what challenges you may be facing. Through therapy, you can change self-destructive behaviours and habits, resolve uncomfortable or painful feelings, improve your relationships, and more.</p>

          <p class="mb-4">As each individual is unique, no one can tell you exactly what your therapy process will be like. During any type of therapy you will establish goals for your therapy and determine the steps you will take to get there. No matter what type of therapy is involved, the relationship between client and therapist is a confidential one that focuses not only on the content of what you talk about, but also the process. The therapeutic process is considered to be just as important as the specific issues or concerns you share in therapy. It includes the comfort level you feel in talking with your therapist, and the manner in which you share your feelings and experiences.</p>

          <p>Overall, you can expect your therapist to provide a healthy and positive relationship, be supportive and attentive to your needs, give you appropriate feedback, and follow ethical guidelines. Appropriate therapy should be tailored to you, your experiences, and your achievement of specific goals.</p>

          <h3>Psychological Assessments</h3>

          <ul class="service-list">
            <li>Learning Disabilities</li>
            <li>Developmental Disabilities</li>
            <li>Behavioral Disorders</li>
            <li>Emotional/Mood Disorders</li>
            <li>Autism Spectrum Disorders</li>
            <li>Attention Deficit Disorders (ADHD)</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="mb-4">Psychological assessments evaluate an individual’s information processing abilities, learning skills, feelings and behaviour. Assessment procedures vary and may include an interview, periods of observation, testing, and consultation with other professionals working with the client. Testing could involve answering various questions, completing pencil and paper tasks, manipulating hands-on items, drawing, and/or completing questionnaires. Educational assessments cover many skill areas, such as intelligence, language, memory and learning, problem solving, planning and organization, fine motor skills, visual spatial skills, and academic skills (reading, math, spelling and writing). Other types of assessment include examination of behaviour and emotions.</p>

          <h4 class="mb-4">Why Have an Assessment?</h4>

          <p>A psychological assessment is helpful in identifying an individual’s strengths and weaknesses. The outcome of an assessment could include a specific diagnosis and lead to important recommendations for academic, therapeutic, or behavioural intervention. By detecting problems, an assessment can be used to assist in planning a student’s school program, identify any needs for ongoing services, and help individuals to access resources in their community.</p>
